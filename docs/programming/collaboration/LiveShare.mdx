## What is LiveShare?

LiveShare is a VSCode plugin that allows people to connect to a host and share a project.

## Why would I need to use LiveShare?

LiveShare is useful for when two people are working on the same project at the same time. This method allows for less back and forth and potential merge conflicts on GitHub. Aditionally you can see what others are working on, making same-time collaboration easier.

## Requirements
- [A GitHub account](../github/Intro.mdx#how-do-i-make-a-github-account)
- WPILib's VSCode
