## What is Git, GitHub, and the difference between them?
Git is a version-tracking program. Think of it like a shopping list; when you want to remove or add something you simply cross out the things you want to remove and add the new things you want, you wouldn't create a new list every single time you want to change something.

Git keeps track of what is changed rather than creating countless copies which would take up unecessary file space.

GitHub is the place where the changes tracked by Git are stored on the internet. Git works on your computer while GitHub works on the cloud, allowing others to interact with your code.

## Why use GitHub? Just store files normally.
GitHub makes version managing a lot easier. When you store files on something like Google Drive or OneDrive, you either can't get back older versions or you have to make many copies of the same program taking up unecessary space.
Having access to older versions can be a lifesaver especially during crunch time when you could make breaking changes, and having the option to go back become very useful.
