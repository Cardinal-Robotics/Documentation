## MDX - What is it and why use it?

MDX is an extension of markdown that allows you to import html (React) features. By default all of our documentation files should be `.mdx` to avoid having a back and forth between `.md` and `.mdx` whenever the extra features provided by `.mdx` is needed.

## If MDX is an extension, what is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple documentation language with easy "markup" features allowing users to easily make fancier text.

You can view the example [here](./Example.mdx).

Here are some of the base features of Markdown:
````md title="Example.mdx"
# Title 1

## Title 2

### Title 3

~~Strike through text~~

**Bolded text**

*Italic text*

```java title="Example code block"
public void resetOdometry(Pose2d pose) {
    m_odometry.resetPosition(
        new Rotation2d(getHeading()),
        new SwerveModulePosition[] {
            m_frontLeft.getPosition(),
            m_frontRight.getPosition(),
            m_rearLeft.getPosition(),
            m_rearRight.getPosition()
        },
        pose);
}
```
