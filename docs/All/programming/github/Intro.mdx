## What is Git, GitHub, and the difference between them?
Git is a version-tracking program. Think of it like a shopping list; when you want to remove or add something you simply cross out the things you want to remove and add the new things you want, you wouldn't create a new list every single time you want to change something.

Git keeps track of what is changed rather than creating countless copies which would take up unecessary file space.

GitHub is the place where the changes tracked by Git are stored on the internet. Git works on your computer while GitHub works on the cloud, allowing others to interact with your code.

## Why use GitHub and not store files normally?
