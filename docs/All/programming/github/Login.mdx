6. Then run these following commands, make sure to substitute the `{USERNAME}` with your GitHub username and the `{EMAIL}` with the email you used in your GitHub account (probably your `@scprep.org` email). Make sure to leave the quotes as is, do not remove them.
    ```cmd
        git config --global user.name "{USERNAME}"
        git config --global user.email "{EMAIL}"
    ```
